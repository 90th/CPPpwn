cpppwn is a modern C++ library that was initially inspired by the popular python libary "pwntools".
Where pwntools however is mainly focused on CTFs, cpppwn is a library that aims to provide helper functions and functionality for hacky, but every day tasks, like interacting with processes or web-servers.
